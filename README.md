# AWS-Machine-Learning-Foundations
Here I have notes and codes from my course in AWS and Udacity, called AWS Machine Learning Foundations

## Description of folders

2. Second-
Only notes of the Usual of Machine Learning
 
3. Third-
Here I have notes and codes about ML tools in AWS. Amazon's system is ready to deal with computer vision(CV), reinforcement learning(RL) and Generative AI problems. Each of these study types are used in AWS sessions like DeepLens(CV), DeepRacer(RL) and Deep Composer(Generative AI for music: AR-CNN, GAN's, Tranformers).
   - [Link to clone a public repository for Generative AI](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-deepcomposer-samples)
   - [Amazon SageMaker pricing documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/pt/sagemaker/pricing/) 

4. Fourth-
Notes and codes for Software Engineering Practices. Clean code, modular code, refactoring, efficient code, Inline comments, docstrings, Version Control
   - [Course "How to create a READme"](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud777)

5. Fifth-
Notes and codes for Software Engineering Practices. Testing, Logging and Code reviews. 
   - [General python TDD(Test-Driven Development)](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/writing/tests/)

6. Sixth-
Notes and Codes about OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) topics. Classes, Objects, Methods(Static, Class, normal), Magic Methods, Inheritance, Mixins, Decorators. Also, create your own package and upload to pip.

   - [Primer on Python Decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/)

- Observation
In "Sixth" is possible to find my Package that was upload to pip. My distribution handles both gaussian and binomial distributions, performing accounts and graphs for each of them.
