"machine learning"
#we can define this area of AI in three main subjects. 
'''
-supervised learning
    training samples that have label as target
-unsupervised learning
    training a dataset to find some pattern or distribution
-reinforcement learning
    find a model by defining a feature to maximize 
'''
"Components of Machine Learnig"
#nearly all tasks solved with ML involves three primary components.
'''
machine learning model - a block of code used to solve different problems
model training algorithm -  determine what changes need to be made, makes small changes to the model
model inference algorithm- using a trained model to generate predictions
'''


"Usual steps in ML" "(begin)"
'''
- define the problem
- build the dataset
- train the model
- evaluate the  model
- inference(Use the model)
'''


#step One: Define he problem
'''
    Define a very specific task.
    - "How do I increase sales?" It's a valid question,
    but it's the opposite of a very specific task
    - “Does adding a $1.00 charge for sprinkles on a hot
    fudge sundae increase the sales of hot fudge sundaes?”
    This is a valid question

    Identify the machine learning task we might use to solve this problem.
    - This helps you better understand the data you need for a project.

    What is a Machine Learning Task?
        Supervised learning
        Unsupervised learning

                                    - Categorical(Classification)
            -Supervised Learning    - Continuous Label(Regression)
    ML Task                         - ...
            
            -Unsupervised Learning  - Clustering
                                    - ...
'''

#step Two: Build a Dataset
'''
    Data collection
    -Does the data you've collected match the machine learning task and
    problem you have defined?

    Data inspection
    -Outliers
    -Missing or incomplete values
    -Data that needs to be transformed or preprocessed so it's in the correct
    format to be used by your model

    Summary statistics
    -mean, standard deviation, inner-quartile range, ...

    Data visualiization
    -You can use data visualization to see outliers and trends in your data and
    to help stakeholders understand your data

'''

#step Three: model training
'''
    Spliting your Dataset
    -The first step in model training is to randomly split the dataset
    -Many developers estimate about 80% in training and the rest, 20%, to make evaluations

    Model Training Terminology
    -model parameters: configurations that can be update to change how the model behaves, during the training
    -loss function: distance from your prediction to the target value
    -hyperparameters: parameters which are not changed during the training, but can affect the accuracy of the algorithm

    Extended Learning
    -Linear models, tree-based models, deep learning
    -usual deep learnings: FFNN, CNN, RNN/LSTM, Transformer

'''

#step Four: model evaluation
'''
    -Log Loss: calculate how uncertain your model is about the predictions it is generating
    -Model Accuracy is the fraction of predictions a model gets right
    -Mean absolute error (MAE), Root mean square error (RMSE), Coefficient of determination or R-squared (R^2
'''

#step five: model inference
